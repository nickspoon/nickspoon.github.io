			<li><b>Homework:</b> There will be weekly homework assignments. We strongly prefer that you write your assignments in LaTeX. Assignments will be submitted on Gradescope.</li>
			<li><b>Report:</b>  An important assessment component of this class is the <i>course report</i>, due at the end of the semester. This will be a short (approximately five pages) report on some topic <i>beyond</i> what was covered in class. This could be original research, a literature review, or a report on some advanced topic in the textbook. This must be an <i>individual</i> project. A project proposal will be due mid-October; more details to follow.</li>
			<li><b>Grade:</b> The overall grade will be 50% homework, 50% report.</li>
			<li><b>Late submissions:</b> Late submissions of homework solutions will be graded with a 20% penalty per day of late submission. Solutions will not be graded if they are submitted later than two days after the specified deadline.</li>
			<li><b>Academic integrity:</b> Please review the <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/master/current_policy.html">departmental academic integrity policy</a> and the <a href="https://cas.nyu.edu/academic-integrity.html">CAS academic integrity policy</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Collaboration and plagiarism:</b> You are free to discuss assignments with your peers, use internet and textbook resources, and seek help on Piazza. However, all submitted work must be your own, and you must acknowledge any resources that you used. In the final report, you must include appropriate citations. Any instance of plagiarism may be subject to investigation according to University regulations.</li>
			<li><b>Participation:</b> Students are expected to attend every meeting of the class and participate in discussions, both in-class and on Piazza.</li>
			<li><b>Religious observance:</b> As a nonsectarian, inclusive institution, NYU policy permits members of any religious group to absent themselves from classes without penalty when required for compliance with their religious obligations. The policy and principles to be followed by students and faculty may be found in the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/university-calendar-policy-on-religious-holidays.html">University Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Disability disclosure:</b> Academic accommodations are available to any student with a chronic, psychological, visual, mobility, learning disability, or who is deaf or hard of hearing. Students should register with the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/csd">Moses Center for Students with Disabilities</a>.
